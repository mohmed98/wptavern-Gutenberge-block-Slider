# wptavern-Gutenberge-block-Slider
Provides the users with a custom Gutenberg block that fetches the latest data using WP REST API from a WordPress site. 

Requered featrues:
- [ ] Display data as a slideshow. Make sure your slideshow covers post title, post featured image, post date, and any other meta-data you can find. Clicking on the title/image should open the original post link.
- [ ] Decide the block’s editorial experience and make it as user-friendly as possible.
- [ ] Think of possible block settings for the block. Toggling various visual elements or metadata of the posts, controlling the behavior of the slider, auto-scroll, rendering manual controls, etc.
- [ ] The slideshow must support keyboard navigation. The right arrow key to move to the next slide and the left arrow key to move to the previous slide.
- [ ] The slideshow must be responsive.
- [ ] Further, on mobile devices, a viewer should be able to swipe with a thumb to move between the next and previous slides.
- [ ] When your page loads, it will display a slideshow for the latest WPTavern’s post, but it must be possible to change it to any website URL and with a click of a button change slideshow content from this website. As an example, we will input rtcamp.com and click a button that should change the slideshow to display rtCamp’s latest blog post.
- [ ] Implement caching for better performance.
